                <p id="cityHistory">
                    Battle Creek acquired its name from a skirmish that took place between a government land surveyor and two Native Americans. 
                    This small skirmish happened more than 175 years ago. Battle Creek has been known by a few different monikers, such as Health 
                    City, International City, and Queen City. Today, however, Battle Creek is known as Cereal City, due to the fact Battle Creek 
                    is the birthplace of the cereal industry.<br>
                    <br>
                    Battle Creek has made its way into the homes of almost every American, by way of the breakfast table. This is the place where 
                    C. W. Post and W. K. Kellogg started their businesses, which are some of the largest producers of Cereal in America today. 
                    Around 1894, C.W. Post developed his first well known cereal “Grape-Nuts”. Not long after that, in 1906, W. K. Kellogg decided 
                    to get into the breakfast cereal business and grew to be a major contender with Post.<br>
                    <br>
                    Battle Creek is also served as a training location for the US Army troops during World War I and World War II, at "Camp Custer", 
                    which was later renamed "Fort Custer". In World War II, Fort Custer also served as an internment center for German Prisoners of War.
                    An Army hospital was established in Battle Creek, named "Percy Jones Army Hospital", and acted as a rehabilition center for wounded 
                    soldiers during and after the war. By the end of the war, it was the largest medical installation operated by the Army. To accommodate
                    the wounded soldiers, Battle Creek became the first city in America to install wheelchair ramps in its sidewalks.
