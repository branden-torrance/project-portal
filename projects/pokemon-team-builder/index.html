                        History of Pokemon Games
                    </h2>
                    <p class="home__section-two__text--paragraph">
                        Pokemon was invented by two Japanese men, Satoshi Tajiri
                        (developer) and Ken Sugimori (artist). The original
                        versions of Pokemon (Red and Blue versions) were
                        released in Japan in 1996, and they were called Pocket
                        Monsters instead of Pokemon. The games were then
                        released in the United States in 1998, under the name
                        "Pokemon". Alongside the game releases, they also
                        released the Pokemon card game, which took to the world
                        by firestorm. Along with the video game and card game,
                        they also created a television series following the
                        protagonist of a young boy named Ash Ketchum.
